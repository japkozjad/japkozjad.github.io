                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>When I was making my second attempt to make a YouTube channel, I was searching for a good nickname which will be original and unique. The idea came from my surname.</p>
                        <br>
                        <div class="exampled">
                            <p>The <span class="podkrl">Japko</span> part has been taken from uncorrectly written word "jabłko" (Eng. "an apple").</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The <span class="podkrl">zjad</span> part is uncorrectly written word "zjadł" which in Polish means "ate".</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Literal translation of my nickname is a person who ate an apple :3</p>

                    <h3>What was your first experience with music? How it started?</h3>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>My first contact with music was when I was probably 10 years old. My mom was playing her favorite song on a keyboard synthesizer, I wanted to play like her, and I guess that's how it started. 3 years later, I installed the demo version of FL Studio 12 because I wanted to try making my own music. Due to the price of this powerful software, I switched to LMMS (Linux Multimedia Studio) because it was free, and it was a good place to start composing music. Since 2022, I've become an active FL Studio user, and I enjoy seeing how far I've come with my creativity as well as my skills.</p>>
